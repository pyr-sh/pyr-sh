        <p>
          Every role is primarily a freelance arrangement, billed using your preferred method. Internationally,
          we support civil contracts, EU VAT invoices and other types of invoices. In Poland, we support B2B
          non-VAT, B2B EU VAT through a non-Polish company and civil contracts (umowa zlecenia, umowa o dzieÅ‚o).

        <p>
          We take pride in being a no-bullshit place to work, with arrangements that resemble a loose cooperative
          of engineers, rather than a company that intends to extract maximized value from their employees.

          If you'd like to apply, please prepare an English CV, a short cover letter and send it to

          <h4>Golang Engineer (Go, optionally Kubernetes)</h4>
          <p>
            We are looking for engineers to work on our Go codebases that power large data analytics platforms,
            IoT backends and early-stage prototypes of both internal and customer-facing projects. Our specialty
            are large-scale, distributed, high-throughput systems backed by PostgreSQL databases. All of our
            architectures are vetted by an engineer with 9 years of experience in developing such Go systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't necessarily have any specific experience requirements - we primarily look for self-motivated
            engineers capable of quickly understanding and extending complicated systems, who can cooperate with
            their coworkers in 3-4 person teams. The pay is scaled accordingly to the value delivered, with room
            for quick growth. Additional points for full-stack experience (GraphQL, React, TypeScript).

          <h4>Frontend Engineer (TypeScript/React/GraphQL/Redux)</h4>
          <p>
            We are looking for engineers to work on our React frontends, including some React Native work. Our
            projects are primarily built using TypeScript, Redux, GraphQL (using Apollo). Most of the work
            consists of creating / reworking UIs according to the clients' requirements, refactoring existing
            codebases using smarter approaches and implementing various new MVP products.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no strict experience requirements - a decent understanding of the React rendering model,
            Redux flows, GraphQL are practically required, however we are willing to explain some aspects of
            the architectures and help with grasping the complicated parts during onboarding. The pay is scaled
            according to the performance.
